# Data
## Summary
Description and data sources for all data used in this project.

## Description of the datasets
### Main data:
**MTL Trajet** – a travel survey conducted by researchers at the Transportation Research for Integrated Planning (TRIP) lab, Concordia University (Patterson & Fitzsimmons, 2017a) parts of which are accessible from the Montreal Open Data Portal (see Data Location).

### Spatial data:
*Note: all geographically-referenced data were re-projected into the Statistics Canada Lambert (or NAD83)*  
**Canada's Dissemination Areas (2016)** – smallest standard geographic area available on the 2016 Canadian census  
**Canada's census subdivision boundary areas (2011)** –   

### supplementary data for analysis:
**Montreal Land Use** – from the Service de l'urbanisme et de la mobilité  

**Points of Interest** – 

**Temperature and Precipitation** – 2-m surface temperature (°C) and precipitation level (mm) data at 1464 1-hour intervals for the dates 18th September 2017 – 18th October 2017 were retrieved from the ERA-5 climate reanalysis dataset produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S, 2017). This data covers a 1°  ́ 1° degree area over Greater Montreal (45° N, - 73° W) and was retrieved in a netcdf4 format through Python using the Climate Data Store API client
