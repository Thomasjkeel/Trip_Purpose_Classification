##### MTL Trajet Final Data #####
Description: Subset, cleaned and pre-processed data from the MTL Trajet travel survey's of 2017. 
The exact processes are detailed in Notebooks/all_preprocessing.ipynb. It has been merged with supplementary data detialed in Data/supplementary_data

Columns: 
id_trip – The Trip's unique id
mode – The mode of transport for trip chosen by the user (see gdf_2016_mode_factors.txt and gdf_2017_purpose_factors.txt for types)
purpose – The reason that the trip has been taken as decided by the respondent (see 
starttime – Timestamp for trip beginning
endtime – Timestamp for trip ending
distance_m – Distance of trip in meters (m)
duration – Duration of trip in seconds (sec)
start_wgs – Latitude/Longitude point of the start of the trip in WGS 84 projection (epsg:4326)
end_wgs – Latitude/Longitude point of the end of the trip in WGS 84 projection (epsg:4326)
start_can – Point of the start of the trip in Canada Lambert projection (epsg:3347)
end_can – Point of the end of the trip in Canada Lambert projection (epsg:3347)
startx, starty, endx, endy – X, Y coordinates of start and end points
hour – Hour in which the trip begins (used for LDA word)
weekday – Boolean of whether the trip started on a weekday or not i.e. Week == 1, Weekend == 0
geometry – The Linestring of the trip's spatial signature

##### X #####
Description: The model's independent variables
Columns:
id_trip – The Trip's unique id
mode_f – The code for the trip's transport mode (see gdf_2016_mode_factors.txt and gdf_2017_mode_factors.txt for types)
duration – Duration of trip in seconds (sec)
distance_m – Distance of trip in meters (m)
weekday – Boolean of whether the trip started on a weekday or not i.e. Week == 1, Weekend == 0

##### y #####
Description: The model's dependent variable:
Columns: 
purpose_f – The code of the trip's purpose (see gdf_2016_purpose_factors.txt and gdf_2017_purpose_factors.txt for types)
