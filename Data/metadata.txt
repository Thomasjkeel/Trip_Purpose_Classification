##### MTL Trajet Final Data #####
Description: Subset, cleaned and pre-processed data from the MTL Trajet travel survey's of 2016 and 2017. 
The exact processes are detailed in Notebooks/all_preprocessing.ipynb. It has been merged with supplementary data detialed in Data/supplementary_data

Columns: 
id_trip – The Trip's unique id
mode – The mode of transport for trip chosen by the user (see gdf_2016_mode_factors.txt and gdf_2017_purpose_factors.txt for types)
purpose – The reason that the trip has been taken as decided by the respondent (see gdf_2016_purpose_factors.txt and gdf_2017_purpose_factors.txt for types)
starttime – Timestamp for trip beginning
endtime – Timestamp for trip ending
precip – Average precipitation rate for trip in millimeters (mm)
temperatur – Average temperature for trip in degrees centigrade (C.)
distance_m – Distance of trip in meters (m)
duration – Duration of trip in seconds (sec)
direction – Direction of the trip in circular degrees (0–360 ø)
magnitude – Magnitude of direction (the strength of the direction at the circular mean)
carddir – Cardinal Direction of the trip's linestring signature
start_wgs – Latitude/Longitude point of the start of the trip in WGS 84 projection (epsg:4326)
end_wgs – Latitude/Longitude point of the end of the trip in WGS 84 projection (epsg:4326)

end_can – Point of the end of the trip in Canada Lambert projection (epsg:3347)
startx, starty, endx, endy – X, Y coordinates of start and end points
startclust – K-means cluster id where the trip starts
endclust – K-means cluster id where the trip ends
hour – Hour in which the trip begins (used for LDA word)
lda_word – The 'Temporal Word' used in the temporal clustering using LDA. An example of a temporal word would be: "Monday_8, Work" == a trip to work on Monday morning 
temporal_c – The 'Temporal Cluster' this trip is determined to be in (for exact calculation see Notebooks/all_preprocessing.ipynb and the 'topic_to_lda' function)

start_down – Boolean of whether the trip starts in Downtown Montreal 1==True (see Appendix X #TODO for Downtown classification) 
end_down – Boolean of whether the trip ends in Downtown Montreal 1==True (see Appendix X #TODO for Downtown classification)
weekday – Boolean of whether the trip started on a weekday or not i.e. Week == 1, Weekend == 0
startrush – Boolean as to whether the trip started in rush hour (6:00–10:00 & 15:00–19:00) 1==True
endrush – Boolean as to whether the trip ended in rush hour (6:00–10:00 & 15:00–19:00) 1==True
thrurush – Boolean as to whether any part of the trip passed through rush hour (6:00–10:00 & 15:00–19:00) 1==True
geometry – The Linestring of the trip's spatial signature
