In conclusion, we present an in-depth analysis into the feasibility of using space and time indicators in trip purpose classification modelling and find that they offer some degree of explanation in seemingly chaotic trip purposes.
Despite this, the modelling approach used in this report only focuses on Montreal and only for one month in September. And to this extent the research is frozen in time and limited by space. We can thus assume, this modelling procedure may have a completely different result for other cities. Moving forward, it is clear that trip purpose classification models will need include more contextual information if we hope to correctly identify key indicators of travel purpose. But, indicators themselves will need to be individualised to specific activities and cities.
