\subsection{Results  from modelling}
Overall, the accuracy of the three trip-purpose classifiers were found to vary in performance between 48.4â€“69.3\% after 5-fold cross-validation (Table 4.9). We see that the MLP and RF only make predictions on 56.4\% and 60.8\% of the data, respectively. One reason for this is that these multi-class classifiers so they evaluate all the trip-purpose classes at once, as opposed to the SVC which evaluates the classes one-vs-one (see Table 4.9). Notably, the SVC is found to performs the least accurately.

When broken down by individual trip purposes in Table 4.10 (as shown visually in Figure 4.24), work and returning home trips were overwhelmingly the most accurately trip- purpose. However, this is likely as this was the predominant class in the dataset perhaps leading to overprediction. MLP was shown to have the highest precision rate, with about half of the trip purposes above 0.5. This indicates that this model was slightly more confident when making prediction for these classes. Additionally, RF was found to have the highest recall for Work and Returning Home trips, indicating this model was the most outright accurate with the classification of these.
