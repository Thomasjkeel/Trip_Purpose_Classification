\begin{abstract}
The prediction of why people travel when they move across cities remains an area within the broader mobility studies without extensive investigation. Arguably, this has been hindered by: (1) an absence of large datasets which detail the purposes of individual’s travel across a city; (2) the difficulty in accurately representing space and time within models used to predict why people travel across cities. 
Regarding (1), in recent years, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) provided by smartphones travel surveys have provided researchers an opportunity to study the attributes characterising urban mobility patterns within a city at increasingly fine temporal and spatial scales. This study makes uses of one such source of VGI: the 2017 MTL Trajet travel survey app – a project with the aim to study how and why people move within the City of Montreal, Canada. Regarding (2), this project builds upon a small body of research to uncover and categorise spatial and temporal interdependencies of GPS data provided from the MTL Trajet project, before assessing the performance of three machine-learning classification models used to classify this GPS data: Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. Specifically, these models are built to classify why people travel based on spatial and temporal characteristics of individual trip.
